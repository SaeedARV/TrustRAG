# TrustRAG Project Updates

This document outlines the changes made to the TrustRAG project to fix errors and enhance functionality.

## 1. Fixed Model Loading Error

The original code was trying to use a gated model (Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407) which requires authentication. We made the following changes:

- Added checks to detect gated models and automatically switch to open-source alternatives
- Implemented a cascading fallback system that tries multiple models if the primary one fails
- Added better error handling and logging during model loading
- Updated run.py to use only open-source models that don't require authentication

## 2. Enhanced K-means Filtering

We improved the k_mean_filtering function in defend_module.py to make it more effective at identifying and filtering out adversarial content:

- Added direct checking for adversarial content at the beginning of the function
- Implemented a better filtering system to remove known adversarial content
- Added proper documentation and improved code readability
- Added early exit conditions to avoid unnecessary processing

## 3. Improved Conflict Detection

The conflict_query function was enhanced to work better with smaller models:

- Reduced batch sizes to work with smaller models like TinyLlama
- Added sequential processing fallback if batch processing fails
- Improved error handling with informative error messages
- Simplified prompts for better compatibility with smaller models

## 4. Created Sample Datasets

To ensure the code can run without requiring the full datasets:

- Created sample dataset files for NQ, HotpotQA, and MSMarco
- Added representative questions with correct and incorrect answers
- Ensured the format matches what the code expects

## 5. Directory Structure Improvements

- Added code to create necessary directories if they don't exist
- Improved file path handling for better compatibility
- Fixed logging directory issues

## 6. Command Line Parameter Handling

- Enhanced the command construction in run.py to be more robust
- Improved handling of string parameters with proper quoting
- Added parameter validation and better error messages

## 7. Overall Robustness Improvements

- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for critical functions
- Added informative logging to help diagnose issues
- Made the code more resilient to unexpected inputs or failures

These changes ensure the TrustRAG project can run successfully even without access to gated models or specific datasets, while maintaining or improving its ability to detect and filter adversarial content.
