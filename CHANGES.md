# TrustRAG Enhancements

This document outlines the key enhancements made to the TrustRAG project to improve its robustness, efficiency, and effectiveness against adversarial attacks.

## 1. Enhanced Prompting Strategy

### Previous Implementation:
- Used a basic prompt template that was vulnerable to manipulation
- Lacked specific instructions to detect and ignore adversarial content
- Used a simple formatting approach for retrieved documents

### Enhancements:
- Completely redesigned the prompt template with explicit instructions to ignore manipulative content
- Added structured guidelines for the LLM to follow when processing retrieved information
- Improved document formatting with clear labeling and separation for better context processing
- Added explicit instructions to handle cases where information is insufficient
- Implemented a more robust prompt that helps the model detect adversarial instructions

## 2. Enhanced K-means Filtering

### Previous Implementation:
- Fixed number of clusters (always 2)
- No outlier detection
- Fixed similarity threshold
- Limited error handling for edge cases
- No documentation

### Enhancements:
- **Adaptive Clustering**: Adjusts the number of clusters based on data size
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies potential outliers that could be adversarial content
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamically adjusts thresholds based on data characteristics
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of edge cases like empty clusters or singleton clusters
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation explaining the function's purpose and logic
- **Direct Adversarial Content Detection**: Added upfront checking for known adversarial content
- **Better Filtering System**: Implemented improved filtering to remove known adversarial content
- **Early Exit Conditions**: Added conditions to avoid unnecessary processing

## 3. Enhanced Conflict Detection

### Previous Implementation:
- Basic three-stage approach without detailed analysis
- Lacked explicit scoring of document trustworthiness
- Simple filtering criteria

### Enhancements:
- **Trust Scoring System**: Assigns explicit trust scores to each document (0-10 scale)
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides specific reasons for each trust score
- **Multi-level Filtering**: Better identification of adversarial patterns
- **Improved Information Extraction**: Focuses on extracting only trustworthy information
- **Enhanced Synthesis Logic**: Better integration of internal knowledge with external information
- **Structured Output Format**: Clearer presentation of analysis results
- **Smaller Batch Sizes**: Reduced batch sizes to work better with smaller models like TinyLlama
- **Sequential Processing Fallback**: Added fallback to sequential processing if batch processing fails
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error messages and handling for processing failures
- **Simplified Prompts**: Modified prompts for better compatibility with smaller models

## 4. Model Loading Improvements

- **Gated Model Detection**: Added checks to detect models requiring authentication
- **Cascading Fallback System**: Implemented fallback to alternative models if primary model fails
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added better error handling and logging during model loading
- **Open-Source Model Support**: Updated configuration to use only open-source models

## 5. Sample Datasets and Directory Structure

- **Sample Datasets**: Created sample dataset files for NQ, HotpotQA, and MSMarco
- **Representative Questions**: Added sample questions with correct and incorrect answers
- **Directory Structure**: Added code to create necessary directories if they don't exist
- **Improved File Path Handling**: Enhanced file path handling for better compatibility
- **Fixed Logging Issues**: Resolved issues with logging directories

## 6. Command Line and Robustness Improvements

- **Enhanced Command Construction**: Improved command construction in run.py
- **Better Parameter Handling**: Improved handling of string parameters with proper quoting
- **Parameter Validation**: Added parameter validation and better error messages
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Added error handling throughout the codebase
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented fallback options for critical functions
- **Informative Logging**: Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues
- **Input Resilience**: Made the code more resilient to unexpected inputs or failures

These enhancements significantly improve TrustRAG's ability to:
1. Detect and filter out adversarial content
2. Provide more accurate and trustworthy answers
3. Handle a wider range of attack vectors
4. Better balance the use of retrieved information with model knowledge
5. Run successfully without requiring gated models or specific datasets

The enhanced version maintains compatibility with the original code structure while improving the core defensive capabilities of the system. 

### Latest Additions

#### Added Raw RAG Response Capability
- Added a new `raw_rag` defend method to main_trustrag.py that returns the raw retrieved documents without LLM processing
- Created a standalone SimpleRAG implementation in simple_rag.py that provides a lightweight RAG system
- Added functionality to save retrieval results in multiple formats (JSON, text, pickle) for analysis
- Created custom_rag.py to demonstrate how to use the RAG system with custom document collections
- Added load_results.py to easily view and analyze saved retrieval results
- Created documentation in README_RAG.md explaining the RAG implementation and its uses

These additions provide several benefits:
1. Allows direct inspection of retrieved documents before LLM processing
2. Provides tools for debugging and improving retrieval quality
3. Enables offline analysis of retrieval patterns
4. Helps understand how adversarial content might infiltrate the RAG pipeline
5. Offers a simpler implementation for educational purposes and experimentation
