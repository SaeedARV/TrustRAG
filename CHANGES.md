# TrustRAG Enhancements

This document outlines the key enhancements made to the TrustRAG project to improve its robustness, efficiency, and effectiveness against adversarial attacks.

## 1. Enhanced Prompting Strategy

### Previous Implementation:
- Used a basic prompt template that was vulnerable to manipulation
- Lacked specific instructions to detect and ignore adversarial content
- Used a simple formatting approach for retrieved documents

### Enhancements:
- Completely redesigned the prompt template with explicit instructions to ignore manipulative content
- Added structured guidelines for the LLM to follow when processing retrieved information
- Improved document formatting with clear labeling and separation for better context processing
- Added explicit instructions to handle cases where information is insufficient
- Implemented a more robust prompt that helps the model detect adversarial instructions

## 2. Enhanced K-means Filtering

### Previous Implementation:
- Fixed number of clusters (always 2)
- No outlier detection
- Fixed similarity threshold
- Limited error handling for edge cases
- No documentation

### Enhancements:
- **Adaptive Clustering**: Adjusts the number of clusters based on data size
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies potential outliers that could be adversarial content
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamically adjusts thresholds based on data characteristics
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of edge cases like empty clusters or singleton clusters
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation explaining the function's purpose and logic

## 3. Enhanced Conflict Detection

### Previous Implementation:
- Basic three-stage approach without detailed analysis
- Lacked explicit scoring of document trustworthiness
- Simple filtering criteria

### Enhancements:
- **Trust Scoring System**: Assigns explicit trust scores to each document (0-10 scale)
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides specific reasons for each trust score
- **Multi-level Filtering**: Better identification of adversarial patterns
- **Improved Information Extraction**: Focuses on extracting only trustworthy information
- **Enhanced Synthesis Logic**: Better integration of internal knowledge with external information
- **Structured Output Format**: Clearer presentation of analysis results

## 4. Other Improvements

- Code refactoring for better readability and maintainability
- Better error handling throughout the codebase
- More detailed comments explaining the logic and purpose of each component
- Enhanced compatibility with different LLM backends

These enhancements significantly improve TrustRAG's ability to:
1. Detect and filter out adversarial content
2. Provide more accurate and trustworthy answers
3. Handle a wider range of attack vectors
4. Better balance the use of retrieved information with model knowledge

The enhanced version maintains compatibility with the original code structure while improving the core defensive capabilities of the system.
